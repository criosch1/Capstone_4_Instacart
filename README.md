## About the Project
My project is an in-depth analysis
In-depth analysis on the relationship between time of day and Instacart orders. I analyzed the “Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”. The
dataset contained a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. I will use the dataset provided by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis). I will be importing the csv files using Python (Pandas). The data was analyzed, cleansed and aggregated where appropriate to faciliate public discussion. The exported cleaned final csv file was used in Tableau to make my presentation.

## Getting Started
  1. Download/Clone the repo
  2. Download the datasets on kaggle 
  3. Open the Jupyter notebook file and make sure all csv files are in the same directory
  4. The Jupyter notebook file will guide you through all my analysis
